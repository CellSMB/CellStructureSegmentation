sbfsem-cardiac-cell-segmenter
=============================
A matlab program to automatically segment cardiac ultrastructure from serial block-face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) data.

**Required Applications/Packages**
----------------------------------
MATLAB

**File and Folder Information**
-------------------------------
main.m: The main script file which the user edits and executes in matlab for running the automatic segmentation algorithm. 
code: The folder that contains the codes for automatic segmenation of the SBF-SEM cardiac cell data.

**Running the program**
-----------------------
1. Open main.m and edit the settings parameters to customise to your dataset. 
2. Run main.m
3. Folders for different organelle components will be automatically created and tiff images of the resulting segmentations will be saved in them. 

Explanations of the settings parameters are given within main.m.
